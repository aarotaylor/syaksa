            The transport came to a stop, powered down and opened to a forest clearing bathed in warm orange light.
            Waist high bushes and shrubs flanked several footpaths that looped around and connected back forming a
            circuit, which made this clearing feel even smaller. The stillness felt foreign; a closer look into the
            distance revealed that the area was surrounded by large boulders and stone walls. Were we being held here?
            My suit read the environment to be remarkably similar to Earth's, 60% Nitrogen, 15% Oxygen, 15% Carbon
            Dioxide, lacking any obvious toxins. Breathable. I could hear noises of the night: insects and nocturnal
            animals going about their business. A quiet breeze rustling leaves. Sounds of home in this alien place. Were
            we transported again? Certainly possible, thats how we ended up wherever we were, flying over deserts and on
            giant megastructures, but that didn't make sense to me. Where was the blinding blue light?

        <p class="naomi-recount">
            We announced our prescence as we stepped out of the transport onto the dense floor, our metallic footsteps
            ringing out in a slow cadence. Tentative, uncertain. Foliage appeared to grow out of obelisks that defined
            the walkways, small pyramid tipped basalt constructs lined with more alien glyphs. I knelt to pick up a leaf
            beside one of them, an optimistic souvenir. It had a long stem, mirrored bilaterally with leaves... and
            immediately thought of the fossil just outside the chamber
            entrance where this all started. I refused to believe this was a mere coincidence.
        </p>




        <p class="naomi-recount">
            Kai had continued ahead towards an obsidian console similar to the one in the transport. More glyphs
            appeared as
            they approached, tinted a cool teal and accented by the orange light flooding in. Images of alien creatures
            shifted periodically, most were unfamiliar, strange, but a few were uncomfortably close to Terranic
            organisms. A
            winged avian form with large eyes and talons, a quadruped with bony growths emerging from its head. A
            jellyfish
            that appeared static, lacking the pulsing movement of the doppelgangers back on Earth. Several that were
            wholly
            unfamilliar. While we were observing the hologram, I noticed movement in my periphery, a shadow. Its owner
            was a
            small furry creature that darted through a previously unseen opening in the wall opposite us. I moved to
            follow,
            finding a short passageway through the [old adjective] stone boulder. Mist flowed softly from the other
            side.

        <p class="naomi-recount">
            I hadn't realized the calming effect this area had on me; a pit formed in my stomach and my breathing became
            shallow again as I stared through the narrow basalt corridor. Flashes of the undersea entrance passed
            through my
            awareness
        </p>

        <p class="naomi-thoughts"><i>why did I insist on getting a sample from the source...surely what we had was
                enough? we would've been on our ascent back to the ocean surface by now...</i></p>

        Dusk light filtered through the fog that flowed from beyond the stone walls, before color faded back to the
        lonely teal projected by the slab.

        <p class="naomi-recount">
            Passing the threshold revealed a scene that was intensely agoraphobic: the trek here had all been done in
            corridors and transports, caves and submarines. Bounded. Confined. To the left and right lay a view similar
            to looking out the window descending into Challenger Deep, punctuated every so often with more incandescent
            pillars. Ahead of us, emerging canopy-first out of the fog, were the tops of titanic trees, casting darkness
            with multiple overlapping shadows falling on the blazing mist. These had to be truly Ancient sentinels. A
            large avian creature, wings outstretched and unmoving, flew straight up across the treetops, uncaring about
            the gravity we were forced to obey. <b>Fear</b> gripped me, forced confinement to where one could see their
            own
            shadow in this strange place, but fear would soon force us out of this exposed position, down the stairs,
            and into the relative darkness of the strange Forest that lay ahead
        </p>


        <p class="naomi-recount">We were barely amongst the low shrubs and below enormous trees when the forest became
            bathed in a penatrating orange. A shadow slilently swept over us as we reflexively crouched behind a shrub.
            It's owner seemingly another shadow, a bipedal silhouette standing in the center of an incandescent pillar.
        </p>

        <p class="naomi-thoughts">"humanoid?" Naomi thought, astonished</p>

        Naomi held her gaze on the motionless figure as she stole glances far above its head, the pillar disappearing
        into the fog; a diffuse warm glow saturating the strange Forest.
