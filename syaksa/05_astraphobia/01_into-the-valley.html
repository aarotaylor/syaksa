                Thunder rumbled off in the distance, yet there was no sign of a storm. Clear blue skies and a light
                breeze, the only thing out of place was a massive pit surrounded by geometric markings on the ground. It
                reminded me of what we flew out of in the desert. We had to be miles and miles away, to see it so
                completely, even this high up. Grazing animals were like ants as they meandered between their several groups around the
                gaping abyss. Oblivious to the rising ground I impacted and deflected down the sloped hills. Skimming
                the tops of the green and brown blades, I braced for the short fall as I disengaged the Decoherence
                Mechanism. Sliding for a few meters produced grass stains on my elbows and knees. As I got to my feet Kai and the Emissaries silently touched down around me, Kai holding back
                a laugh after watching me hit the ground. Gazing into the valley, the uncultivated expanse within
                something so artifical entranced us; questions shouldered their way into awareness. Left alone, life
                will do as it always does and settle into a niche. Whether it currently exists or not is irrelevant,
                Equilibrium is sought out, and it will be found. Energy, will always be conserved. Life evolves as a
                response to its environment, so how do they fit into this?

                A quiet pressure permeates the land, directionless, omnipresent. Disconcerting. Thunder rolls lazily
                through the valley, but this was something different. The animals seem to pick up on it as well, herd
                boundaries have become fuzzy and several individuals left altogether, galloping toward the distant
                hills.
            </p>

            <p class="naomi-thoughts">Are they afraid?</p>

            <p class="naomi-recount">Exposing my palm and placing it on the ground let a resonance enter my body, soft
                electricity flowing from my hand, up my forearm and into my spine. The familiarity sent a sharp pang of
                <em>fear</em> that settled in my stomach. I could feel a subtle increase in intensity and pulled my hand
                from the ground, letting my suit cover it once more.
            </p>

            <p class="naomi-thoughts"><i>Perhaps that's why they're fleeing, in greater numbers now too.</i></p>

            <p class="naomi-recount">
                A soft buzzing lingered in my fingers as lightning shot from the chasm in the center of the valley.
                Thunder asserted itself as late morning gave way to twilight, with a quickness like that of a total
                solar eclipse.

                Looking toward the sky I half expected a black disk with smooth, silky white flames
                burning around the circumference, yet there was nothing. The sky remained less than forthcoming about
                letting us witness anything other than...sky. This place had no moon, no sun for that matter. It had
                nothing, the closest thing to Oblivion incarnate at its core, and I couldn't help but wonder what those
                animals knew, and why they no longer surrounded the thundering chasm.
                As the intensity grew even further, the tracks I witnessed during the descent
                slowly came alive, parallel snakes headed by massive boulders. Coiling; constricting.

                Twilight faded to night as the sky fractured into numerous irregular obsidian slabs with a familiar
                incandescent glow that shone through the boundaries. Networked constellations criss-crossed the sky in
                lieu of stars.

                A few beats pass, then we get hit with the shockwave. The Emissary provided a hologram of the mirrors to
                observe since the frozen mirrors, white hot and blinding, were too bright to look at. The edges of each
                of the mirrors are the only visible area of light; the rest of their surface is focusing light that we
                can't see, but could render planets extinct with no heed time.

            Naomi watched the ground on the other side of the barrier as rocks and pebbles began to float. Even though
            she was untethered, she could feel the raw strength of the electric and magnetic fields as the station
            accounted for changes in the incoming GRB. The deep resonance of the engine warping spacetime itself,
            forcing her own personal reference frame to respond.
