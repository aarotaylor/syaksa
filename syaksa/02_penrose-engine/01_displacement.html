                The chamber had barely changed, but the wall I found myself looking at resembled an open-door elevator ascending an impossibly tall high rise. We were moving fast, and speeding up. I turned to view the rest of the chamber, monoliths still ran around the edge of the room connected by a network of teal lines. Looking at the obsidian console, the two hologlyphs were now joined by a third, rapidly shifting set. The walls on either side of me were smooth and featureless.

                > Before long, a deep, omnipresent vibration made its presence known, and the obsidian black console marked in glyphs came alive. The chamber became bathed in a winter sky blue, and all we could do was marvel as the walls dropped away, and the impact rang down.

                We were surrounded by a sea of dark, glassy, crystalline pillars scattered haphazardly. Our view barely changed as we raced up. Entranced, I stepped between two obelisks and pressed my helmet against the transparent wall, looking out into the cerulean abyss. The view was eerily familiar to the one we had outside the tiny porthole as we dove deeper into the Pacific, an endless blue. Without warning the viewport went dark, I almost fell at the sudden contrast. Light still flooded in from the opposite wall, and was the only source of light for several seconds before my view was restored. I'm not sure how fast we were going, but suffice to say the pillars were massive.

                > I froze at the next impact as it permeated my very being. Entering the nape of my neck it felt like pathways were being traversed, routes being mapped. Up and down my spine I felt energy spread and pool in my head, down my back and into my legs. Behind my shoulders to the outsides of my forearms before fading to nothing. I felt <b>scanned</b>
