            It came on us in moments, like dropping weight on our backs. The chamber had barely changed, but as I looked
            for support, the wall I found myself looking at became a blur; thin streaks of light
            shot down past the viewport. We were ascending fast, and speeding up.

            We were surrounded by a sea of dark, glassy, crystalline pillars scattered haphazardly. Our view barely
            changed as we raced up. Entranced, I stepped between two obelisks and pressed my helmet against the
            transparent wall, looking out into the cerulean abyss. The view was eerily familiar to the one we had
            outside the tiny porthole as we dove deeper into the Pacific, an endless blue. Without warning the viewport
            went dark, I almost fell at the sudden contrast. Light still flooded in from the opposite wall, and was the
            only source of light for several seconds before my view was restored. I'm not sure how fast we were going,
            but suffice to say the pillars were massive.

            nothing. I felt <b>scanned</b>

        <!-- Impact 3; First of main intensity-->
        <p class="naomi-recount infrasound text-between">> Fear gripped me as the next infrasonic impact held my lungs,
            forcing them
            still. I tried to turn and see Kai, but I couldn't move. Energy saturated me, the feeling of electricity
            resonating within, freezing my muscles. My fingertips screamed as it felt like lightning tried to arc from
            them. The impact rang down, giving time only for a staggered inhale and brief control of my body before
            another impact washed over us.</p>

        <!-- Impact 4-->

        <!-- Impact 5-->
        <p class="naomi-recount infrasound">> Released once more I collapse to the ground on my hands and knees.
            Coughing, I could feel the adrenaline dumping into my bloodstream; blood rushing through my ears, the
            pounding in my chest. Tense, I let my suit support me as I struggled to control my shaky breathing, and by
            extention my mind. An impact had come and gone, soft electricity flowing down my spine, out to my limbs.</p>

        <p class="naomi-thoughts">what the hell...</p>

        <!-- Impact 6-->
        <p class="naomi-recount">The vibrations shook me to my core yet I remained in control of myself. I took several
            deep breaths and shifted to sit as I scanned the chamber. The hologlyphs still hovered over the obsidian
            slab, and as my gaze shifted to the smaller blur of teal below, darkness fell upon the chamber. Kai Once
            more those strange geometric hologlyphs...six and eight, what significance did those unchanging symbols
            carry?</p>

        <p class="naomi-thoughts">the big ones aren't changing, could they represent this transport? or perhaps where
            it-- where <i>we</i> are going? what then of the blur? speed? coordinates? i can't make anything out...</p>

        <p class="naomi-recount infrasound">> We emerged from the wall of a massive enclosed area, the teal hue traded
            for natural rays tinged with a sandy tan. Sunlight. We flew toward the center of a gargantuan cylinder,
            topped with a painted circle of wispy whites and deep blues far above, while below an incandescent glow
            reflected off the smooth interior walls. Walls which saw falling sand and dust permeate the cavity with
            large sandy clouds, nearly obscuring the far side of the enclosure. The transport gained speed as it moved
            upwards toward the center of the space.</p>

        <p class="naomi-recount">As Kai turned to help me up, I noticed small, irregular reflections flowing upwards,
            from the floor of the transport to the ceiling along the wall opposite the console. Looking out I witnessed
            flashes of light from the far side of the enclosure, peeking through breaks in the dust clouds. Massive
            frozen deposits of some crystalline substance littered the wall, catching the light from below and above.

        <!-- Sustained Impact Group 2-->
        <p class="naomi-recount infrasound">> Shooting past the surface revealed the pit was in a massive erg, sand
            plains completely surrounded by dunes that touched wispy desert clouds high above the basin. Sandfalls
            peppered the rim.</p>

        <p class="naomi-recount">We continued to climb faster and faster, feeling the heat radiating through the
            viewports. Kai had opened his visor, our suits read the atmosphere breathable, but I opted to keep mine
            sealed. They could only measure basic chemical compositions, and I didn't want to take my chances with
            anything else. Both of us gazed out at the undulating dunes, sharing a brief moment of distraction from the
            current events, attempting and failing to process how we ended up here in the first place. There was a tacit
            understanding that all we could do was wait to see where we arrived.</p>

        <p class="naomi-recount">Something was off though, my gaze darted across the sky as I turned to view out the
            opposite wall; not searching <i>for</i> something per se, I sensed an absence... </p>

        <p class="naomi-dialogue"><i>"There's no sun. We're above any clouds, yet all I can see is sky"</i></p>

        A puzzled look came over Kai's face as he came to the same conclusion.

        <p class="kai-dialogue"><i>"Yeah, you're right, maybe the atmosphere blocks it somehow? Could be hazier than we
                see." </i></p>

        <p class="naomi-thoughts">Maybe, it ultimately made no difference though. We were travelling <i>away</i> from
            where we came, and there was no walking back. We couldn't even walk forward. We were stuck. This transport
            was on a set path, so we were too. Whose path?</p>

        <p class="naomi-thoughts">Another enclosure?</p>

        "We aren't slowing down" Kai said, backing away from the front window.

        "I can see that, let me just hit the e-brake" I replied, hoping the transport would respond.
