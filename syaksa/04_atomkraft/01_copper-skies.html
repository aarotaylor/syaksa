        <p class="naomi-recount text-between">
            I awoke to copper skies and auburn sunbeams. My visor was covered in dew droplets with mist permeating the
            air. Distant clouds glimmered in the warm light as the pillars that kept us company in our odyssey slowly
            blended with the sky. The walkers had stopped, and upon my stirring began to diffuse.</p>

        <p class="naomi-recount text-between" style="display: none;">
            I found myself lying on my right side watching the walker-mist gather at the cliff's edge before blowing
            behind me toward the forest, through several massive machines that resembled hourglasses laid on their side.
            Torn between the imposing structures and the ethereal morning sky, I approached the ledge on all fours to
            peer over the cliff. Clouds prevented any view more interesting than the writhing roots, although I could
            see a circular halo surrounding the shadow of my head. As the clouds began to burn away, I started to unpack
            the events that brought us here, back to the sillhouettes... I had a sense we would make proper contact
            soon.
        </p>

        <p class="naomi-recount" style="display: none;">
            I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths to take in our surroundings [describe the audible atmosphere,
            the calm. Nearly imperceptible forest sounds as the morning progresses]. Kai was still motionless, lying on
            their back to my left. The walkers had placed us in a circular clearing at the edge of the forest, almost
            entirely encircled by roots of the giant trees. We sat upon soft grass, which began to ripple at the
            periphery of the clearing [make clearer that the ripples are from the roots, that they deform the ground in
            a frozen green ripple].
        </p>

        <p class="naomi-recount text-between">
            Machines stood like sentries at the edge of the Forest, mist tethered in long laces to
            the center of the hourglass-shaped constructs. They pooled in the clearing, where Kai lay as if in a deep sleep, before continuing on into open air,
            a river of fog. A low hum emanated from each of them, with pulsing light from where the two bulbs met.
        </p>

        <p class="naomi-recount text-between">
            The ambiance was broken with the sound of a rock tumbling onto the gravel behind me. Turning around were the
            two
            humanoids from earlier, now crouched on the ground, motionless.
        </p>

        <p class="naomi-recount text-between">
            I froze completely, eyes wide, darting between the two newcomers. That one a few paces behind the first had
            an L-shaped pack on its back. A few beats pass. The crouched one's head tilted from side to side, as if it
            was examining us, contemplating something. If they wanted to harm us they would've ambushed, what do they
            want? As if they could read my thoughts rhythmic gutteral noises originated from the standing one, with a
            silky smooth voice with an accent I couldn't place following from its crouched companion:

        <p class="naomi-thoughts">
            they're being awfully considerate...

        <p class="naomi-recount text-between">
            Hearing some rustling I turned to face the cliff, Kai had their right knee on the ground, arms motionless in
            a half raised "I surrender". His eyes darted between me and the humanoid figures. The crouching creature
            continued:

            Stopping roughly a meter in front of us and with a tilt of their heads, the speaking entity waved their
            six-fingered hand and our suits began transforming, Large packs formed on our back, yet there was no
