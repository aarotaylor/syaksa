                I awoke to copper skies and auburn sunbeams. My visor was covered in dew droplets with mist permeating the air. Distant clouds glimmered in the warm light as the pillars that kept us company in our odyssey slowly blended with the sky. The walkers had stopped, and upon my stirring began to diffuse.</p>
                
            <p class="naomi-recount">
                I found myself lying on my right side watching the walker-mist gather at the cliff's edge before blowing behind me toward the forest, through several massive machines that resembled hourglasses laid on their side. Torn between the imposing structures and the ethereal morning sky, I approached the ledge on all fours to peer over the cliff. Clouds prevented any view more interesting than the writhing roots, although I could see a circular halo surrounding the shadow of my head. As the clouds began to burn away, I started to unpack the events that brought us here, back to the sillhouettes... I had a sense we would make proper contact soon.

                I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths to take in our surroundings [describe the audible atmosphere, the calm. Nearly imperceptible forest sounds as the morning progresses]. Kai was still motionless, lying on their back to my left. The walkers had placed us in a circular clearing at the edge of the forest, almost entirely encircled by roots of the giant trees. We sat upon soft grass, which began to ripple at the periphery of the clearing [make clearer that the ripples are from the roots, that they deform the ground in a frozen green ripple].
            </p>
                
            <p class="naomi-recount">
                The machines stood like sentries at the edge of the Forest, mist hung in the air in long laces tethered to the center of the hourglass-shaped constructs. It pooled in the clearing before continuing on into open air, a river of fog. A low hum emanated from each of them, with pulsing light from where the two bulbs met. The ambiance was broken with the sound of a rock tumbling onto the gravel behind me. Turning around were the two humanoids from earlier, now crouched on the ground, motionless.
            </p> 
                
            <p class="naomi-recount">
                I froze completely, eyes wide, darting between the two newcomers. That one a few paces behind the first had an L-shaped pack on its back. A few beats pass. The crouched one's head tilted from side to side, as if it was examining us, contemplating something. If they wanted to kill us they would've ambushed, what do they want? As if they could read my thoughts rhythmic gutteral noises originated from the standing one, with a silky smooth voice with an accent I couldn't place following from its crouched companion:
            </p>

            <p class="emissary-dialogue"><i>They make clouds, you have no need for fear here.</i></p>

            <p class="naomi-recount">
                Hearing some rustling I turned to face the cliff, Kai had their right knee on the ground, arms motionless in a half raised "I surrender". His eyes darted between me and the humanoid figures. The crouching creature continued:
            </p>

            <p class="emissary-dialogue"><i>There are many many more scattered throughout this ring. You are compatible with these, hence we brought you here.</i></p>

            <p class="naomi-thoughts"><i>this</i> ring?</p>
            <p class="kai-thoughts"><i>compatible?</p>

            <p class="naomi-recount">
                My mind was racing, curiosity and fear struggling to each have their time in the driver's seat. I remained motionless, frozen, trying my best to give no reaction at all, which still spoke volumes. I returned a mildy curious expression. The entity that carried an L shaped mechanism on its back spoke some more unintelligible sounds, its partner followed:
            </p>

            <p class="emissary-dialogue " id="be-not-afraid"><i>You have no need for fear, we mean you no harm. Apologies for bringing you out of the <em>Forest</em> in such a rush, it wasn't safe for you there, and it still isn't right now. We must descend to the habitat proper for your safety; Inaction means death for you.</i></p>
