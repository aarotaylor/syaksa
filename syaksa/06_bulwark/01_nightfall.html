            The once imposing orange monoliths were now hairline fractures in the sky above; networked constellations of irregular obsidian slabs over lava extended far beyond the distant mountians. It was night once more and she couldn't pull her gaze from the strange starless sky. Both pairs stood at the edge of the pit the animals once congregated around, a breeze at their backs. 
            
            <p class="emissary-dialogue">We fall again, into an entrance amongst the caves in the upper substructure</p>
            
            This massive abyss stretched from horizon to horizon with a warm orange glow emanating from somewhere deep below the surface.

            The image of the black hole framed within the mirrors had burned itself into her memory; not unlike totality during the height of the previous Solar Eclipse. The only difference being the knowledge that something lay behind the disk of the moon, here there was no knowledge. Were the beings that built Syaksa as ignorant of black holes as we are? Surely not, one would think that making such exotic constructs must come bundled with complete understanding. However, humanity has proven that it has had its fair share of attempting to utilize powers it knew little of.

            <p class="kai-dialogue">"Hey Naomi, you think these are what we saw through the dust clouds? and what's that chipping away at it"</p>

            

            <p class="naomi-thoughts">they said <i>upper</i> substructure... how big is this place exactly?</p>

            They fell towards an open shaft in the wall, slowing down gradually, until they touched down in a cave system. the Emissary and Sentinel led them through the worm-like tunnels back into the bowels of the station. As they walked, the loose, shifty dirt ground gave way to gravel, and then firm stone, footsteps echoing as the walls became more dense, reflective. The circular winding tunnels gradually transforming back into the angular, artificial passageways and corridors they had first encountered before they made Contact. Before the <em>Forest</em>.

                <i>...a logistics problem, all energy transfer. Nothing works if energy doesn't get to where it needs to go.</i>
            </p>

            Something tugged at the back of her mind, a notion of oneness. A notion that Syaksa was much more than the sum of its parts, no mere station. Much like in her own body, there were systems for transporting resources, transporting energy, dealing with unwanted intruders, maintenance and upkeep, the whole of it. As different as she and Syaksa were, they shared a great deal. She knew she was conscious and aware, so what sort of awareness could the Overseer, could Syaksa, truly have?

            <p class="naomi-thoughts">...what about proton decay?</p>

            The Second Law reared its head again, not even this Glider could escape the forces that bound itself. Naomi opened her eyes to darkness, froze, then blinked a few times.

            <p class="naomi-dialogue">"Hey can you see?"</p>
            <p class="kai-dialogue">"Yea, let your eyes adjust a little"</p>

            <p class="naomi-dialogue">"wh-"</p>

            again. not relevant. they likely had minutes to get back to the sub.
            
            <p class="kai-dialogue">"why what?"</p>
            <p class="naomi-dialogue">"-eh nevermind, suit batteries are low, we need to get back blind. your drone still there?"</p>
